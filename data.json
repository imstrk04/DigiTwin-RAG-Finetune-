This means that RMAP can coexist with other SpaceWire protocols on the same network without conflicting with them. 5.2 Addressing Requirements The RMAP protocol defines the use of unique global 32-bit addresses for RMAP messages and RMAP port objects. All nodes that are implementing the RMAP protocol must be registered with an RMAP address management system. Port objects are used to represent the interface of a SpaceWire node, and different nodes may have different port objects. 5.3 Messages The RMAP protocol uses a message-based communication scheme, where messages are exchanged between nodes using the global address of the target node and port objects. Each message has a defined message type, which indicates the purpose of the message. There are several message types defined in the RMAP protocol, including command messages, response messages, and bulk transfer messages. These message types are further divided into sub-message types, depending on the specific functionality of the message. 5.4 Response The response to an RMAP command or request is generated by the receiving node and sent back to the originating node. The response message has the same message type as the command or request message, but carries additional information or status code to indicate whether the operation was successful or not. If the operation was not successful, the response will contain an error message. 5.5 Requirements The RMAP protocol allows for multiple nodes to be connected to a SpaceWire network and communicate with each other using global addresses. To achieve this, nodes must support unique global addresses and be registered with an RMAP address management system. Additionally, nodes must support the RMAP message types and follow the message-based communication scheme defined in the protocol."

Logical address identifiers can be used for various types of memory addressable storage elements, such as random access memory, registers, FIFO, and mailboxes. In a SpaceWire packet, the logical address identifier is used to define the path address sequence, which specifies the route to a target by specifying the output port of each router encountered on the way to the target. The protocol identifier data character is also used to identify a particular protocol being used for communication."

        "output": "In the context of SpaceWire, a \"request primitive passed from a service user to a service provider to request a service\" means a command sent by a user or application to a service provider in order to access a specific service or functionality. This request is typically sent as a message or packet, which is processed by the service provider and responded to accordingly. The \"or to indicate that some commanded action has been completed by the target\" refers to the reply message or packet that is sent back to the user or application to indicate that the service request was successful or that there was an error. This reply message often includes the result of the service request, as well as other relevant information. The \"target SpaceWire node that responds to a command sent by an initiator\" means a device or system that is capable of receiving and processing SpaceWire commands from a user or application.

This standard specifies such a protocol identifier. The protocols that operate over SpaceWire are then specified in the ECSS E ST 50 5x ser ies of standards. Examples of these protocols are: \uf0b7 Remote Memory Access Protocol (RMAP) The aim of RMAP is to support reading from and writing to memory in a remote SpaceWire node.

This protocol is used to transfer data packets between SpaceWire nodes that are using CCSDS-MCD/A-AP, the Common Command and Data Handling Message Protocol for Autonomous Platforms. \n\nIn summary, the use of a protocol identifier in SpaceWire protocols ensures that different protocols can be distinguished from each other and can be properly communicated over a SpaceWire network."
